            <p>Hi - Hola - Sup - Mahalo - Kia Ora!!! Welcome to a site dedicated to ME!!! Whhhhhaaaaaa??? Yes you read
                that's right.
                We had to make this site after learning html and css as a class assignment. It's a pretty imersive and
                frankly I found out many
                ways to reach from point A to point B. That being said it was a challenge to develope code that will
                withstand time.

                But I digress - - -
            </p>
            <p> Who am I? Lets start with where I'm from - Melboure, Australia, Earth, Solar System, Orion Spiral Arm,
                Milky Way Galaxy, Local Group, Virgo Supercluster, Universe. Which is pretty cool and accurate
                directions if you're an alien!</p>
            <p>I'm a lady ;) and I love both cats AND dogs. I'm super blind but that's fine I have glasses!</p>
            <p>I like to read - J. R. R. Tolkin, J. K. Rowling and Rick Riordan are some of my favourite authors.
                I love comics; Kamala Khan as Ms Marvel is my favourite. I also collect Funko Pops!.
                On top of that I love sci-fi and comedy and anime TV shows. I'm currently watching RWBY.
            </p>
            <p>On a more serious note I have a B.Comm from the University of Melbourne. I have experience as a Product
                Manager at a software company. I'm also a certified Scrum Product Owner.
            </p>
            <p>ISo here I am. There isnt much to go on this site yet. But this is an
                outcome from two weeks of
                coading background. There's only up from here.
            </p>
