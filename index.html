            <p>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms
                and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a
                hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.</p>
            <p> It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the
                exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without
                smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and
                lots of pegs for hats and coats - the hobbit was fond of visitors.</p>
